# End to End LLM Project Using LangChain, Google Palm In Ed-Tech Industry


In this comprehensive Language Model (LLM) project, we're leveraging the capabilities of Google Palm and LangChain to develop a Q&A system for CodeBasics, an e-learning company specializing in data-related courses and bootcamps (website: codebasics.io). Currently, CodeBasics manages learner inquiries through Discord or email. Our objective is to create a streamlined solution using Streamlit, LangChain, and Google Palm to facilitate direct student interaction and reduce the workload on CodeBasics' human staff.

**Project Highlights**

1.Utilization of an actual CSV file containing FAQs currently employed by CodeBasics.  
2.Integration of LangChain and Google Palm to construct an LLM-based question and answer system, aiming to alleviate the burden on human support staff.  
3.Development of a Streamlit-based user interface, allowing students to ask questions and receive prompt responses.  
4.Implementation of Huggingface instructor embeddings for text embeddings.  
5.Incorporation of FAISS for vector database functionalities.  

**Learning Objectives:**

**Participants in this project will gain hands-on experience in the following areas:**

LangChain and Google Palm for LLM-based Q&A systems.  
Streamlit for creating a user-friendly interface.  
Huggingface instructor embeddings for text representation.  
FAISS for efficient vector database management.  

**Project Structure:**

'main.py': The main script for the Streamlit application.  
'langchain_helper.py': A module containing all the necessary LangChain code.  
'requirements.txt': A file listing the Python packages required for the project.  
'.env': Configuration file storing the Google API key.
